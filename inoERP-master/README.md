inoERP is an  **[OneApp](https://docs.rikdata.com)** (Go back-end & Flutter front-end) based enterprise management system. The ERP systems contain all the required modules for running small to midsize businesses. The features are similar to Oracle R12/ Cloud Application and SAP ECC/Hana S/4. 

The application uses MySQL database and OneApp JavaScript APIs to create business logic. All the database and javascript codes are available on GitHub.

The client is available for Andriod, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Web.

The server is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

***The web client is experimental and doesn't have all functionalities of native clients (Windows/macOS/Andriod/iOS). The performance of the web is also not at the same level as a native client. So, try the application with a native client and use the above URL in your native client.***

## Server
------------
## MySQL

1. Install MySQL  Ver 8.0.+
2. Change MySQL settings on the config.json file
````
{
      "dbConnName": "Inoerp",
      "dbType": "MySQL",
      "host": "localhost",
      "portNumber": 3306,
      "dbName": "inoerp",
      "userName": "YourDbUserName",
      "password": "YourDbPassword",
      "connPoll": 5,
      "maxConnPoll": 10,
      "defaultRowLimit": 5
    }

````
3. Import the database

````
mysql -u root -p < /home/files/inoerp.sql

````

database file is available @ assets\db\mysql folder

The import process will create the required inoerp schema.


````
CREATE DATABASE  IF NOT EXISTS `inoerp` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci */ /*!80016 DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='N' */;
USE `inoerp`;
SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
````

Ensure ***SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;***

## Settings

1. Enter server hostname and port on the config.json file
````
  "application": {
    "protocol": "http://",
    "hostName": "localhost",
    "portNumber": 8085,
    "certFile": "",
    "keyFile": ""
  },

````

2. Change any other settings on the config.json file as per business requirement

## Start/Stop
 You can start the server like any other application. You can stop the server using OneApp Desktop/Mobile client. You can also send a REST request to Your host/stop to stop the application. To send a stop request, you must have admin authority.

````
 ./oneapp_win.exe
 
````

or in Linux

````
nohup ./oneapp_linux &
 
````


## Client

Access the application using any client of your choice. The clients are available for
* Andriod
* Windows
* macOS
* iOS
* Web


[Download Client](https://docs.rikdata.com/docs/download)

The console will show you a message stating the host and port when the server starts. Server start should not take more than 10-15 seconds.

````
Starting server @ localhost:8085
 
````

Open the application in a browser and test that you can login with the default username and password (admin/admin)

## Dynamic pull System
------------
The idea behind inoERP is to provide a dynamic pull-based system where the demand /supply changes frequently and traditional planning systems (such as MRP or Kanban) are incompetent to provide a good inventory turn.

A dynamic pull system is an advanced version of a pull system that encompasses the best feature of the traditional pull system & MRP. The major disadvantage of the conventional Kanban system is the fixed Kanban size and requirement of at least two bins for the entire operation. In a sudden demand decrease, the Kanban system can result in extra inventory, and the value of unused inventory can go up to 2 bin size. Similarly, In case of unexpected demand increases can result in a line down, and the issue will be severe if the lead times are not short.

The dynamic pull system overcomes this issue by recalculating the bucket size (Kanban size/lot size) before creating any supply (requisitions/purchase order/work order). Each time a new supply is created, the system automatically decides the best supply size per the actual demand.
